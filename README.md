# Video Anomaly Detection with CLIP

This project focuses on video anomaly detection using a CLIP-based zero-shot learning approach.

Surveillance video frames are segmented and analyzed to detect abnormal events without additional model training.  
The goal is to explore zero-shot anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

## Technologies
- Python
- CLIP (Vision-Language Model)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Status
Academic research project (TÜBİTAK 2209-A).
